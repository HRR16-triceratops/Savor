There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
    Savor: A Restaurant Recollection Application

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
    For food and beverage enthusiasts who desire to remember every meal.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
    Savor is a restaurant recollection app that helps people briefly remember each meal. Users rate restaurants in four categories: food, service, ambience, and price, upload photos, and add a short note about their experience.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
      Restaurant hobbyists typically must use hand-written journals to keep track of their eating adventures. These paper version can be easily damaged or lost. They are not easily searchable either and incapable of holding pictures (without the effort of printing and pasting them).

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
    With Savor, you will be able to create more consistent entries with standardized criteria for judgement. Instead of having to keep track of a physical notebook, your notes will always be available online with corresponding photos. No matter how many memories your have, your new setup will make them easily searchable.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
      I'm not just a spokesperson for Savor, I'm a customer too. Savor allows restaurant enthusiasts to easily stay committed to their goal of documenting their restaurant experiences. It has never been easier to stay organized and timely with your meal memories.
## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
    Get started in 3 easy steps. Create a Savor account, click the pencil icon to input your first memory, and then refresh the page to see your online restaurant recollection take shape!

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
    Before Savor, I had a hard time staying committed to my hobby. I love eating at restaurants, but taking the time to handwrite my thoughts about the meal was a pain. Now, it only takes me 2 minutes to add my opinions. I haven't forgotten a meal since.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
